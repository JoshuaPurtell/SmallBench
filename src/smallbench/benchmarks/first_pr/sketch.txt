Scrape PRs from small repos, then post-process them like this:
- Identify intent
- Identify natural scope
- Turn scope into 3 scopes: small, medium, large
- One PR for each -> planned, executed, tests created

Filtering github repos
- check for recent activity
- screen for code quality / code that works?
